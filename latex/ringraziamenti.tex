\emph{I want to thank all the people that have supported me during these three years: my parents, who never failed to provide me with everything I needed and were always there for me; and my closest friends, who lightened my mood in my most stressful periods.}

\emph{A huge thank you goes also to the people that helped and guided me in writing this thesis: first of all, Daniele Miorandi and Carlo Caprini, who relentlessly offered me the best advice and support whenever I needed it during my internship; all the U-Hopper team, which unfortunately I could not meet in person due to Covid restrictions, but who still made me feel like I was working in such a friendly environment; and Alberto Montresor, who is responsible for introducing me to U-Hopper in the first place.}
